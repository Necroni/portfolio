# It's Fun to Brag
Telling your own story is hard, but bragging is fun! This is my portfolio - the one time in your life that you can brag freely.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My portfolio is a labor of love, optimized for exactly what I need it optimized for: basic presentation of my skills.

My focus is not on design - it's on clean engineering, effective presentation, and access. This style of site can be spun up in a day or two on nearly any platform you desire: self hosted, Wordpress, Heroku, Netlify, or wherever your dreams might take you. This specific version is live on Netlify, but only because there is no significant backend.

## Optimizations

What do you want a portfolio to DO? What service should it provide? For me, the service is delivered just fine - a single place to see who I am, what I do, and how to get ahold of me. Sure, maybe the images could be converted to .webp, or the responsive widths could be adjusted to modern devices. If I had extra time available, I'd also consider working with a designer to customize something more attune to my style.

## Lessons Learned:

1) Know your strengths and lean into them. If you aren't a designer, it's okay to use someone else's design.
1) Having a clean product is better than a flashy one that breaks.
1) Serve the purpose first, then add sugar.
